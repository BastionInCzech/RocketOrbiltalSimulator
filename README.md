# RocketOrbiltalSimulator
Hey there fellow! This program is due to my poor programming practice very... confusing and not really commented. 
I know. I should do it but I didn't. (Yet?)

Program needs python3 with matplotlib preinstalled (That should be somehow included in the project, but again, not the best programmer)

Program simulates 2D orbital behavior for either plain objects or for proppeled ones. (With fuel, consumption and engine force)
you can define properties of the craft in the code (this part is suprisingly commented, try to find it, object named orbital)
It draws object's path using matplotlib.pyplot.plot around earth (you can change the mass and radius of the body the craft orbits)
It refreshes the graph every 1000 simulated seconds (can be changed in definition of function path())

Feel free to use it and tinker with it as you wish (good luck orienting in my code), if it has any meaningful part in project of yours,
credit would be nice. Enjoy! 

(Suggestions about including matplotlib in this (making a build or something (I really don't know that) very welcome)
